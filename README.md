# My Engineering Manual [Source codes]
This manual records and summarizes the solutions to my daily problems encountered in coding, projects or software operations. Unlike API documentation organized by a formation like ``from API to usage illustrations'', this manual is demand-oriented. This is to say, this manual is organized in a formation of that from demands (e.g., how to complete specific tasks on reading a file or construct an array) to tools, which are collected from various resources like the API documentation and the Stack Overflow website as well as the Quora website, etc.
